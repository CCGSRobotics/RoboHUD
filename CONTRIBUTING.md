# Contributing to RoboHUD

## For those who have an idea of what they would like to do & how to do it

If you have an idea and don't need much guidance - great! The [specifications document](https://app.gitbook.com/@ccgsrobotics/s/specifications/) might have some useful information surrounding more detailed information, so you don't have to go looking through the code.

## For those who need some guidance

Check the [feature requests](https://github.com/CCGSRobotics/RoboHUD/projects/2) project, or the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CCGSRobotics/RoboHUD/issues). Take a look around, ask questions, and see what interests you! Additionally, you can always come down to TG11 to have a chat, see what we're working on and discuss what you can contribute.

The work-in-progress [guide](https://app.gitbook.com/@ccgsrobotics/s/robohud/) may also be of some help for those starting development.

## Linting your code

The file [lint.py](Scripts/lint.py) can be utilised to easily lint code that you have been working on. For example, if you want to lint your HTML file and supporting JS file, you can use the following code:

`python3 Scripts/lint.py App/index.html App/JS/client.js`

## Creating a pull request

Once your code has been written, [make a pull request](https://github.com/CCGSRobotics/RoboHUD/compare) so that your contributions can be merged into the repository's master branch!
